# Arduino_ZModem

A fork of [ecm-bitflipper's Arduino_ZModem](https://github.com/ecm-bitflipper/Arduino_ZModem) - tweaked to let it run on the [Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2796) using [Bill Greiman's SdFat](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat).

Seems to work OK with [Hilgraeve HyperTerminal](https://www.hilgraeve.com/hyperterminal/). Haven't yet got it working with [ExtraPuTTY](http://www.extraputty.com/)

Enjoy!
